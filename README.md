# Detection of invasive fungal infection in cytology and histopathology reports

### Data
We make use of the [Cytology and Histopathology Invasive Fungal Infection Reports (CHIFIR)](https://www.physionet.org/content/corpus-fungal-infections/1.0.2/) dataset available at PhysioNet. Please note, the dataset is available under credentialed access and requires the user to sign the PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data Use Agreement. 

### Analysis
Our goal was to classify the reports as positive or negative for the evidence of invasive fungal infection (IFI). We combined a dictionary-based named-entity recognition approach with a simple logistic regression classifier. The methods and results are outlined in our paper ["Detecting evidence of invasive fungal infections in cytology and histopathology reports enriched with concept-level annotations"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104293).
